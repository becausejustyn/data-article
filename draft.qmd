# Introduction

This document demonstrates the use of a number of advanced page layout features to produce an attractive and usable document inspired by the Tufte handout style and the use of Tufte's styles in RMarkdown documents [@xie2018]. The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto[^1] supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.
